      <description>Introduction In this article, we will explore time series data extracted from the stock market, focusing on prominent technology companies such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Our objective is to equip data analysts and scientists with the essential skills to effectively manipulate and interpret stock market data.
To achieve this, we will utilize the yfinance library to fetch stock information and leverage visualization tools such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to illustrate various facets of the data.</description>

      <description>Introduction Percolation theory is a fundamental concept in statistical physics and mathematics that describes the behavior of connected clusters in a random graph. It is a model for understanding how a network behaves when nodes or links are added, leading to a phase transition from a state of disconnected clusters to a state where a large, connected cluster spans the system. This transition occurs at a critical threshold, known as the percolation threshold.</description>
