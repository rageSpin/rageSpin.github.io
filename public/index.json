[{"categories":["Finance"],"contents":"Introduction In this article, we will explore time series data extracted from the stock market, focusing on prominent technology companies such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Our objective is to equip data analysts and scientists with the essential skills to effectively manipulate and interpret stock market data.\nTo achieve this, we will utilize the yfinance library to fetch stock information and leverage visualization tools such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to illustrate various facets of the data. Specifically, we will explore methods to analyze stock risk based on historical performance, and implement predictive modeling using GRU/ LSTM models.\nThroughout this tutorial, we aim to address the following key questions:\nHow has the stock price evolved over time? What is the average daily return of the stock? How does the moving average of the stocks vary? What is the correlation between different stocks? How can we forecast future stock behavior, exemplified by predicting the closing price of Apple Inc. using LSTM or GRU?\u0026quot; Getting Data The initial step involves acquiring and loading the data into memory. Our source of stock data is the Yahoo Finance website, renowned for its wealth of financial market data and investment tools. To access this data, we\u0026rsquo;ll employ the yfinance library, known for its efficient and Pythonic approach to downloading market data from Yahoo. For further insights into yfinance, refer to the article titled Reliably download historical market data from with Python.\nInstall Dependencies pip install -qU yfinance seaborn Configuration Code import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import seaborn as sns sns.set_style(\u0026#39;whitegrid\u0026#39;) plt.style.use(\u0026#34;fivethirtyeight\u0026#34;) %matplotlib inline #comment if you are not using a jupyter notebook # For reading stock data from yahoo from pandas_datareader.data import DataReader import yfinance as yf from pandas_datareader import data as pdr yf.pdr_override() # For time stamps from datetime import datetime # Get Microsoft data data = yf.download(\u0026#34;MSFT\u0026#34;, start, end) Statistical Analysis on the price Summary # Summary Stats data.describe() Closing Price The closing price is the last price at which the stock is traded during the regular trading day.

However, this does not tell us anything about the actual profitability of these models.\nPossible trading performance The strategy implementation is:\nBUY: if prediction \u0026gt; actual_price SELL: if prediction \u0026lt; actual_price To close a position the next candle close is waited. However, LSTM and GRU has some offset that does not allow a proper utilization of this strategy.\nHence, the returns of the predictions are adopted.\n# Assume a trading capital of $10,000 trading_capital = 10000 pred_gru_df = pd.DataFrame(predictions_gru, columns=[\u0026#39;Price\u0026#39;]) pred_test_df = pd.DataFrame(y_test, columns=[\u0026#39;Price\u0026#39;]) pred_gru_df[\u0026#39;returns\u0026#39;] = pred_gru_df.pct_change(-1) pred_test_df[\u0026#39;returns\u0026#39;] = pred_test_df.pct_change(-1) # Compute Wins wins = ((pred_gru_df.dropna().returns\u0026lt;0) \u0026amp; (pred_test_df.dropna().returns\u0026lt;0)) | ((pred_gru_df.dropna().returns\u0026gt;0) \u0026amp; (pred_test_df.dropna().returns\u0026gt;0)) print(wins.value_counts()) returns_df = pd.concat([pred_gru_df.returns, pred_test_df.returns], axis=1).dropna() total_pos_return = pred_test_df.dropna().returns[wins].abs().sum() total_neg_return = pred_test_df.dropna().returns[np.logical_not(wins)].abs().sum() # compute final capital and compare with BUY\u0026amp;HOLD strategy final_capital = trading_capital*(1+total_pos_return-total_neg_return) benchmark_return = (valid.Close.iloc[-1] - valid.Close.iloc[0])/valid.Close.iloc[0] bench_capital = trading_capital*(1+benchmark_return) print(final_capital, bench_capital) returns True 81 False 72 Name: count, dtype: int64 10535.325897548326 9617.616876598737\nConclusion As showed in the previous section, these two simple Deep Learning models exhibits interesting positive results both regarding regression and trading metrics. The latter is particularly important, indeed a return of 5% is obtained while the stock price decreased of approximately 4%. This also lead to a very high sharpe and colmar ratio.\n","date":"June 16, 2024","hero":"/posts/finance/stock_prediction/gru/images/stock-market-prediction-using-data-mining-techniques.jpg","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/finance/stock_prediction/gru/","summary":"Introduction In this article, we will explore time series data extracted from the stock market, focusing on prominent technology companies such as Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

It is a model for understanding how a network behaves when nodes or links are added, leading to a phase transition from a state of disconnected clusters to a state where a large, connected cluster spans the system. This transition occurs at a critical threshold, known as the percolation threshold. The theory has applications in various fields, including material science, epidemiology, and network theory.\nWhy is Percolation Important? Useful Applications Percolation theory provides insights into the behavior of complex systems and phase transitions. Here are some key applications:\nMaterial Science Percolation theory helps understand the properties of composite materials, such as electrical conductivity and strength. For example, the electrical conductivity of a composite material can change dramatically when the concentration of conductive filler reaches the percolation threshold.\nEpidemiology In studying disease spread, percolation models can predict the outbreak and spread of epidemics. The percolation threshold represents the critical point at which a disease becomes widespread in a population.\nNetwork Theory Percolation theory is used to study the robustness and connectivity of networks like the internet or social networks. It helps understand how networks can be disrupted and how to make them more resilient.\nGeophysics In oil recovery, percolation theory models the flow of fluids through porous rocks, helping to optimize extraction processes.\nForest Fires Percolation models can simulate the spread of forest fires, aiding in the development of strategies for fire prevention and control.\nPython Simulation Code Here is a simple example of a site percolation simulation on a square lattice in Python:\nimport numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import scipy.ndimage def generate_lattice(n, p): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Generate an n x n lattice with site vacancy probability p.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; return np.random.rand(n, n) \u0026lt; p def percolates(lattice): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Check if the lattice percolates.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; labeled_lattice, num_features = scipy.ndimage.label(lattice) top_labels = np.unique(labeled_lattice[0, :]) bottom_labels = np.unique(labeled_lattice[-1, :]) return np.intersect1d(top_labels, bottom_labels).size \u0026gt; 1 def plot_lattice(lattice): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Plot the lattice.\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; plt.imshow(lattice, cmap=\u0026#39;binary\u0026#39;) plt.show() # Parameters n = 100 # Lattice size p = 0.6 # Site vacancy probability # Generate and plot lattice lattice = generate_lattice(n, p) plot_lattice(lattice) # Check percolation if percolates(lattice): print(\u0026#34;The system percolates.\u0026#34;) else: print(\u0026#34;The system does not percolate.\u0026#34;) This code generates a square lattice of size n with site vacancy probability p, checks if the lattice percolates (i.e., if there is a connected path from the top to the bottom), and plots the lattice.\nGitHub Repositories For more advanced simulations and visualizations, you can refer to the following GitHub repositories:\nSimulating Percolation Algorithms with Python: This project models percolation using Python, Tkinter for animation, and matplotlib for graphs.
