      <description>1. Introduction In the dynamic world of finance, options play a crucial role in risk management, speculation, and portfolio optimization. An option is a contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a predetermined price (strike price) within a specific time frame. The challenge lies in accurately pricing these financial instruments, given the uncertainties in market movements.</description>

      <description>Introduction Percolation theory is a fundamental concept in statistical physics and mathematics that describes the behavior of connected clusters in a random graph. It is a model for understanding how a network behaves when nodes or links are added, leading to a phase transition from a state of disconnected clusters to a state where a large, connected cluster spans the system. This transition occurs at a critical threshold, known as the percolation threshold.</description>
